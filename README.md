# WP3_infrastructure

### NCITA Repository Unit Work Package 3: Infrastructure

The aim of WP3 is to document useful information relating to the installation and implementation of XNAT at different sites in the NCITA consortium. The CRUK NCITA consortium (Cambridge, Institute of Cancer Research, Imperial College, KCL, Manchester, Oxford, UCL) manages a set of XNAT instances (which we intend to federate in future). Given the heterogeneous nature of the environments at our respective institutions, we have evolved a few different ways of installing XNAT and we hope to collect here a set of browseable information that other teams may find useful as they think about how best to implement XNAT in their own situations.

The NCITA Repository Unit site as a whole is at an early stage of the life cycle and does not currently have a formal structure of documentation releases. Please bear with us: things will become more organised as the NCITA project gets into gear! Note in particular that, for the WP3 repository, there is a Wiki that contains a variety of useful information in addition to the files in the `docs` folder.
